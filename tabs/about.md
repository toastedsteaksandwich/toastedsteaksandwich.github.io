Hi, I'm Ashiq. I currently work at [iosiro](https://iosiro.com/) as a security consultant. 👨‍💻 In my free time, I play CTFs under the team name [toastedsteaksandwich](https://ctftime.org/team/120123/) and try my luck at [bug hunting](../external), usually looking for bugs in smart contracts. I'm proud to say that since ~April 2021, I've helped protect $6.5m worth of cryptoassets from permanent hack damage, and over $2.5b from temporary hack damage across my disclosed and undisclosed bugs in production. 🙇‍♂️

I'm always keen to chat about what's new in infosec/blockchain/DeFi - feel free to connect through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AshiqAmien) :)
