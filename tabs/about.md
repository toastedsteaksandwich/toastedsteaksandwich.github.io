Hi, I'm Ashiq. I currently work at [iosiro](https://iosiro.com/) as a security consultant. 👨‍💻 In my free time, I occasionally play CTFs under my team name [toastedsteaksandwich](https://ctftime.org/team/120123/) and try my luck at [bug hunting](../external), usually looking for bugs in smart contracts.

I'm always keen to chat about what's new in infosec/blockchain/DeFi - feel free to connect through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AshiqAmien) :)
